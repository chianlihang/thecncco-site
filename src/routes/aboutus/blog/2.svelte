        Hi, this is my first post here so I’ll take some time to explain a little about who I am, what I like to do,
        and what I would like to accomplish.

        My name is Zachariah Clark and I grew up in the small town of Little Egg Harbor in the Pine Barrens of
        South Jersey (Of course today we call it the Pinelands because it turns out not to be quite as barren as
        we thought). Well, to me growing up it seemed barren and boring, nothing but pine trees in sandy soil
        on flat ground with almost no topology and grassy wetlands near the coast. Now that I’ve been away a
        while I’ve learned to appreciate some of the unique beauty of my hometown, specifically one small
        Osbourne Island which was where I lived and enjoyed childhood. The island is only about 3 miles in
        diameter with a small forest and lagoons or canals penetrating inland down every street so that almost
        every house would have direct access to the Great Bay and the Ocean. The few houses which were not
        on a lagoon were those which bordered the forest, and that was my situation. I spent my time exploring
        the forest and building forts with the few other kids who lived on the island. Those early years were
        simple and fun, full of imagination and adventure and with no worries of the future whatsoever.

        That lifestyle persisted until my sophomore year of high school. Before then I took school as a drag and I
        had no real ambition. Up to that point school was effortless and I was proud to say that I didn’t study
        and that I could skip homework assignments because I could do well enough on exams to make up for it.
        Getting B's was plenty for me - but my carelessness caught up to me as I failed my world history class in my
        freshman year. After that, one solid conversation with my Dad changed my outlook on learning in
        general. He emphasized being observant of the things around me and that you can find pride and joy in
        understanding something. From then on I took learning much more seriously and I found out quickly
        that the mindset of wanting to understand something for my own satisfaction motivated me much more
        than just getting good grades, and my grades improved anyway.

        I got the habit of learning things directly from the textbook because I could go through at my own pace
        (much faster at times and far slower at others) and make certain I understood something before
        proceeding. And also unlike my teachers, the textbook was unlikely to mis-speak and ingrain a misconception or
        erroneous idea. Throughout the rest of high school I continued to understand who I was, but I still spent
        no time seriously considering the future. I only applied to college the second semester of my senior year
        and I only took the SAT once and I only applied to one school, Rutgers. Despite how I changed in high
        school in regard to learning, I still resented the rat race and all the things that you’re told you’re ought
        to do. I still only did the bare minimum there. I resented anyone who talked about professional plans
        where wealth and status seemed to be the driving factors. I began to desire to retreat away and live in
        the forest by myself with a self-sufficient lifestyle. I had fantasies about how I would live and how I could
        make a laboratory and experiment and create things for my own satisfaction. I relished the idea that I
        could be happy without bothering with any of the things that everyone seemed so obsessed about. At
        that time I hadn’t realized that my fantasies were not as easily achievable as I thought. I seriously lacked
        the skills and competence necessary at the time, and I didn’t know what I didn’t know.

        In college I behaved the same as I did in highschool, I bought the textbook and enjoyed the learning
        process on my own, but I got into the bad habit of skipping classes (something I never considered in high
        school). My decision to skip classes came equal parts from laziness and resentment. I resented now how
        other students took courses. Aiming for a grade and missing the point seemed even truer at college. On
        the other hand the lack of rigidity in my schedule lead to lazy behavior. Throughout freshman year I was
        able to maintain good grades, but I struggled to do as well for the next three years. Up until my junior
        year my future was still a fantasy of a self-sufficient lifestyle, but the turning point in my life came when I
        joined a newly started engineering team in college, RRPL. As a part of a team to make rockets to fly in
        Las Cruces New Mexico I put my practical skills to the test for the first time. I quickly learned that how I
        imagined making something was far less complicated than reality and that even seemingly simple things are
        a challenge to do correctly. That first competition that we went to was the most challenging mission I
        had ever undertaken despite how simple the construction was in hindsight - but it was a success and that
        changed what I wanted to achieve.

        Instead of isolation I wanted to work on large projects and learn real skills where I could finally
        transform my studies into something concrete. I found that the thing which motivated me more than
        learning something new was applying theories to real engineering. Another two years of work leading
        the rocketry team continued to test me. Despite early success with our first simple rockets, as we made
        them more capable we found our first hard failures. Rockets where telemetry cut out and drifted
        beyond any hope of recovery, or were unstable at the insane accelerations achievable in amateur
        rocketry, or where parachutes didn’t deploy at all and all of our hard work would plummet to the
        ground ballistic from 10,000 feet. Amongst these failures were many successes, and I learned the power
        of an iterative approach to engineering. Design-Build-Destroy-Redesign. Iteration is the key to success,
        and the desire to make something perfect from the start is hardly ever achievable and often prevents
        progress.

        Now that I’ve graduated, my desire to build useful products and my inclination to not get caught up in
        the corporate ladder lead me to consider what my options were. I had spent so much energy on
        rocketry the last few years and wanted to continue but I didn’t have the funds or the equipment to
        make progress. Then I had the idea that a company could be built around making the equipment and
        from that both money and equipment could be found while still being true to my goals - and that’s how I
        found myself here.
