        Buna Ziua, my name is Alexander Sanducu and yes, I am Romanian. Along with this I am one of the founders of THE CNC COMPANY and the aim of this blog is to introduce you to me and a bit of my story in an effort to connect with our potential customers. So without further ado, it's time for me to do my first ever blog post as well.
    </p>

    <h5>Get To Know Me</h5>
    <br>
    <p>
        I was born in 1997 to first generation immigrant parents from Romania (in New York), learned English as my second language (couldn’t tell it though) and soon moved to New Jersey. It was in NJ that I was able to begin my engineering journey. In high school I befriended my chemistry teacher and it was he who showed me my first snippet of designing and building by teaching me to make RC planes out of just foam and some electronics. This opened my mind up to just making things and influenced my life moving forward.  With access to a driveway and garage in NJ, I was able to take this new drive and apply it to all of the cars in my family, with varying degrees of success. I had dreamt in HS of getting a project car to throw myself into and by the summer of 2015 I had found what I was looking for... her name was Miranda.

    <p>
        I really dove deep into Miranda’s inner workings and decided to fully rebuild her engine in 2017 as I planned to keep her and pass her down to my kids. It was also, coincidentally, where I found myself constantly biting off more than I can chew, but thanks to the internet and help from family and friends, I was able to finally finish the rebuild after 2 long years.

        From 2015-2019 I was enrolled in Rutgers University under their newly created Aerospace Engineering degree program. It was here that I had my entire life plan reality checked. I came from HS as a high performing student and thought that maintaining good grades would not be a real challenge for me. BOYYYY was I wrong. Through a combination of poor choices and life difficulties, I found myself failing most of my first semester. I was informed that I was now on academic probation and if I did not maintain a certain GPA for next semester I would be dismissed from the Rutgers Aerospace program. I was determined not to let that happen. Well, 1 semester later and I fell 5 exam points short of the grade I needed to be above the minimum GPA requirement. Then came the academic dismissal letter with 2 options:
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>1. Transfer out of the Engineering school into another Rutgers school</p>
    <p>
        2. Attempt 2 summer classes, maintain a certain GPA, and then go in front of a review board to determine if they should let you back into the program - BUUUT with one big condition: if the review board determines that I should not be accepted back into the engineering program, then I would no longer be allowed to attend the entirety of Rutgers.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        I was faced with my hardest decision to date. I had wanted to be an aerospace engineer since middle school but now that I was in the right place and time for it, I seemed incapable of handling it. Was I not good enough? Am I just kidding myself for ever considering stepping up and becoming what it took to get through the aerospace curriculum? I remember just how potent the self-doubt was and I wasn't sure what I should do. In a moment of determination, I decided that I could pick myself up and continue. If I just gave up I would never give myself the chance to see if I could really do this. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        One summer semester later and I was cleared to continue my studies under the aerospace program at Rutgers. The reason I wanted to share this story in particular with all of you is because I look back at this period of my life and I realize now that had I not reached that low, I would not have been a fraction of the person I needed to be to get to the point of starting this company. Only after my biggest struggles in college was I able to examine my situation and forge ahead with a newer, stronger path. It was my freshman year experience that drove me to get involved with student engineering teams. I refused to let my grades be the only way to judge my growth and skills as an engineer. So, I joined the newly formed Rutgers Solar Car Team in Spring 2017 and applied to be its first ever Mechanical Team Lead (mind you I knew nothing about designing mechanical components for something like A CAR!!). This was my first experience with leadership and it taught me much. By fall of 2017, I was Mechanical Team Lead for Solar Car. I was also looking to start a much needed organization at Rutgers: a rocketry team. By the spring of 2018 I was the captain of this newly formed group and while still working with Solar Car. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        By 2019 I graduated with my undergrad degree in Aerospace engineering and had proven to myself that I had what it took to be an engineer, not just because I made it through the curriculum but because I used my time to learn as much as I could through my extracurriculars and pushing as many buttons as possible to make my dreams a reality. Instead of just parting ways, I felt Rocketry and Solar Car still had so much potential and I wanted to find a way to stick around another year. Graduate school seemed impossible for someone with my low GPA. However, throughout college I had doubled down on the fact that real engineering projects teach true value and integrate the lessons taught in school and chasing after the grades is not going to make you a better engineer. This must have shown as I was given a probationary spot in the graduate school. In 2021, after 2 years, I was able to successfully graduate with a Masters of Engineering in Aerospace on a 3.5 GPA (Not that this defined my skill but it was a big accomplishment for me personally after a rough ride in undergrad). Things had come full circle and I closed that chapter of my life.

        Now I won't go into details in this post as I feel I have already gone so in depth with everything just leading up to my involvement with those student teams, but it is those student team experiences and hardships that I believe further shaped me into the person I am today. Let’s just say that in the very early days absolutely no one in the administration was willing to fully believe in a group of students and made us have to fight for every inch of ground we gained. I think it built character haha.

        I will be ending this section with what I've given you all so far. I've been told by many people that I am a “story hog” and I love to tell stories, and considering how long just this section of the blog is, it must be true. So I will be leaning into that by telling interesting stories and adventures from those days. But not in this blog post, you will need to come back for those. 
    </p>

    <h5>Company Formation</h5>
    <p>
        In March of 2021 my graduation was looming ahead of me and I was still unsure about my future career plans. I had some conversations with Zach about starting a company that would eventually tie into our work with rocketry. I felt that I had two choices, and although I could get a job somewhere in aerospace and start building my career, I also felt that once I got into that sector, I would not have the same people and opportunities around me as I do now to try something daring. The formation of THE CNC COMPANY would still align with my engineering career and open up the most interesting paths forward. If there was ever a time I was going to try something bold and risky, it was going to be now. Thus, the idea of THE CNC COMPANY came to fruition and myself, Zach, and Chianli began working out of half a garage to build our MVP, the Carpenter. My role was to work on designing that first machine and making it a reality. With that came the adventure of designing, manufacturing, and debugging our very first creation. 2 months after we first came together, Carpenter was making its first cuts. It was a very exciting time that led to us renting the place we operate out of now.

    <h5>My Work at thecncco</h5>
    <p>
        So what do I do at THE CNC COMPANY now? I do a lot of the same as in the beginning, with some expanded roles for sales and customer projects. The days start with a meeting to discuss where we all stand and what we are going to work on. For large portions of that time, Zach and I would be designing our newest machine, aptly named, Machinist. These designing sessions are sometimes intermingled with creating customer project signs and whatever other small projects we may have that day, whether that be for the company directly or for upgrading our workspace. Sometimes that means updating old model designs to get better rendered images for Chianli to work with, or just tweaking existing designs and comparing their benefits both practically and economically. We strive to approach building this machine as a challenge in keeping it low cost but still constructed from items people can easily source, such as our extrusions or widely available electronic components brands. When integrating all the parts in our design, we ask ourselves, “could this be made simpler and with less parts?”, “ is this easily manufacturable?”, “ where can we integrate 3D printed objects to complement the machine and lower the cost?”. In doing so, we believe we are building a foundation for a new range of CNCs that the maker community will help elevate to new heights. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        With that, I’d like to talk about what I see for the future of the company. As Chianli mentioned in his post, it's a tough one to say considering we have yet to find and build our community and to bring our machines to the public. However, we started this in order to solve a problem that we faced as student engineers. We were taught to design parts, learned how to manufacture them, but could not get access to the machine necessary because of the high price tag associated with most reliable machines that have a strong company behind them. I imagine there are many makers around the world who have felt this frustration. The frustration of wanting to learn something new, but not having the funds or available resources to do so comfortably. We are aiming to change that. We are makers ourselves and I look forward to being able to use our CNC machines to open the door for us back into the world of rocketry and who knows, maybe one day we'll get to see our logo on the side of our rocket built using our machines. One thing is certain, it is impossible to succeed if we do not try.
